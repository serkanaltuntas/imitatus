Imitatus is designed to have **zero production dependencies**. It uses only Python's standard library components for all core functionality. This design choice provides several benefits:

- 🔒 Enhanced security with no third-party dependency risks
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight installation
- 🎯 No version conflicts with other packages
- 📦 Maximum portability across Python environments

### Development
For development and testing, we use several high-quality tools:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
